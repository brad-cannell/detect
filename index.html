<section>
  <h1>About DETECT</h1>
  <p>Detection of Elder Abuse Through Emergency Care Technicians (DETECT) is a community-academic collaboration project, which aims to identify and prevent occurrence of elder mistreatment in the community. Key collaborators include <a href="http://www.uth.edu" target=_blank>The University of Texas Health Science Center</a>, <a href="http://www.medstar911.org/" target=_blank>MedStar Mobile Healthcare (MedStar)</a>, <a href="http://www.unthsc.edu" target=_blank>The University of North Texas Health Science Center</a>, <a href="https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Adult_Protection/" target=_blank>Texas Adult Protective Services (APS)</a>, and <a href="https://www.fwscc.org" target=_blank>The Fort Worth Safe Communities Coalition</a>.</p>
  <p>To date, the most notable product to come out of the DETECT project is an elder mistreatment screening tool, which is called the DETECT screening tool. The DETECT tool was designed specifically to help emergency medical services (EMS) providers identify potential elder mistreatment among community-dwelling older adults during an emergency response. DETECT relies entirely on the medics’ systematic observations of the older adult’s physical and social environment — no direct questioning of the older adult or their caregivers is involved. The intent was to create a tool that was easy for medics to use in the field and that helps them capture information that is thought to be related to elder mistreatment. </p>
